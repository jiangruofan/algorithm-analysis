[URL Shortening System Design](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2869646/URL-Shortening-System-Design)

[System Design | React & Commenting System](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2847000/System-Design-or-React-and-Commenting-System)

[Google|Onsite|L4](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2872386/GoogleorOnsiteorL4)

Build a multi-threaded processing unit which processes message from N input topics. Messages on each input topic arrives in increasing time stamp. Processing unit must ensure that Message with lower time stamp are processed before. At a particular system would have a timestamp watermark indicating that messages before this timestamp has been processed across all  
Topics.  
For each input topic there is corresponding output topic.  
Processing unit can have configurable threads m such that m<=n where N is the topic.

topic 1: t2, t2, t2, t1, tl, tl, t0, t0 ----------simple transform------ output 1  
topic 2: t3,t1, tl, tl, t0, t0 -----------simple transform----- output 2  
topic 3: t4,t3,t2, t1, t1, t1 ----------simple transform------output 3  
topic 4: t5, t4, t2, t0 ----------simple transform------output 4

algorithmic,but further followup also asked how to optmize and scale

Initial approach:

-   Mapping of topic: in_topic -> out_topic
-   Custom queue that takes a list of topics, we'll call  `CustomQueue`

For  `CustomQueue`, it's similar to an external merge sort, you'll have a priority queue that buffers the head of each message from each topic. When you poll from  `CustomQueue`, poll from the priority queue, then read a message from the corresponding topic to replace it in the priority queue. Apply your transform and write it out to the expected output topic - this timestamp is now the latest timestamp (high watermark) you have, store it, and periodically broadcast this message to all output topics.

To improve on this, instead of reading one message at a time, each topic should maintain its own buffer of messages. Our current approach is a single consumer model, you can expand this to a multiple consumer model, but implementation will depend on the provided constraint: (A) message with lowest timestamp must be processed first OR (B) message with lowest timestamp must be sent first. With (A), you can serialize the processing but parallelize writing it to the output but with (B) you can parallelize processing and serialize the sending.

[TikTok | 2-2 Senior | System Design and Behavioral](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2965137/TikTok-or-2-2-Senior-or-System-Design-and-Behavioral)

Imagine you have 100 new iPhones and you're going to sell them at a massive discount for a promotion for $100/phone. This promotion starts at exactly 12:00. You anticipate 100 million users will try to buy the phones. Design a system for this promotion.  
My approach:

1.  Have a CDN with 2 pages - one page allowing people to enter a waiting room and one page telling people that the phones have been sold.
2.  From 12:00:00 to 12:00:10, you show the page to enter the waiting room. After 12:00:10, you show the page telling people the phones have been sold.
3.  Only 1,000 people are allowed in the waiting room. The rest are told the phones have been sold.
4.  The first 120 people in the waiting room are allowed 5 minutes to complete their purchase. If 100 phones sell, then the remaining 20 are told that the promotion is over.
5.  If the phones don't sell immediately, the you must allow people from the waiting room to try to purchase the phones in a FIFO manner.
6.  Make sure to use a SQL database to manage the inventory for the iPhones.
7.  If the waiting room service fails, then you must start recovery. Use a messaging queue to restore the waiting room service.

[Spinny round 2| LLD - Design Call Center](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2963473/Spinny-round-2or-LLD-Design-Call-Center)

Problem: There is a call center in which there is a hierarchy of employees who can attend the call. Freshers should attend the call first, followed by leads and finally the manager. If the fresher wants to escalate the call he/she can escalate it to the leads. Also, a lead can escalate the call to the manager. We can suppose that there are many freshers, many leads, and only one manager. If at any point in time no employees are free to attend the call, the caller should wait in the queue. Once an employee is free he/she can take the call.

Found a medium article regarding this question:  [https://medium.com/@mithoonkumar/design-call-centre-ood-9f5d3baff82a](https://medium.com/@mithoonkumar/design-call-centre-ood-9f5d3baff82a)

Verdict: Rejected. I couldn't think of an efficient way of adding the callers to queue.
