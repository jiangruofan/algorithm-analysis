[Google|Onsite|L4](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2872386/GoogleorOnsiteorL4)

Build a multi-threaded processing unit which processes message from N input topics. Messages on each input topic arrives in increasing time stamp. Processing unit must ensure that Message with lower time stamp are processed before. At a particular system would have a timestamp watermark indicating that messages before this timestamp has been processed across all  
Topics.  
For each input topic there is corresponding output topic.  
Processing unit can have configurable threads m such that m<=n where N is the topic.

topic 1: t2, t2, t2, t1, tl, tl, t0, t0 ----------simple transform------ output 1  
topic 2: t3,t1, tl, tl, t0, t0 -----------simple transform----- output 2  
topic 3: t4,t3,t2, t1, t1, t1 ----------simple transform------output 3  
topic 4: t5, t4, t2, t0 ----------simple transform------output 4
