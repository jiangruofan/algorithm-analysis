**Partition String**  
You are given a string S of lenght N of digits 0 - 9. You need to partiton strings into K substrings such that

-   Each substring has a minimum lenght of M
-   Substring must start with even digit and ends with odd digit number

Determine the number of ways to partitioin the strings which satisfy the above condition  
You should find answer modulo 1e9 + 7

constraints :  
1 <= n<= 2x10^3  
1<= m<= n  
1<=k<=n

Test cases

```
n = 9 
m= 2
k = 3
s = '232387421'
So there are total 3 ways possible 
```
