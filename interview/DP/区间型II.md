[Walmart Intern Question](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2792749/Walmart-Intern-Question)

**Can anyone tell the code for this question!**

Alice is playing a game. In this game, an array A of N cards is given with some associated points. The task is to reduce the array to a single element. It can be achieved by operating a certain number of times. For every operation, Alice is awarded some points, and the total score would be the sum of points awarded overall operations.

The operation is defined as:

Select a contiguous subarray (i,j) starting at index i and ending at index j from A with at least two elements, and replace it with the sum of the subarray elements. The points awarded for this operation is (-1+1)"ming, where ming represents the minimum value in subarray (i,j).

â€¢ Print the maximum possible score Alice can get.

Constraints:  
1 <= n <= 60  
-1e9 <= A[i] <= 1e9
