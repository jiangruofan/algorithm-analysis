Q4:

You are writing an internet server for a version of Battleship game. The game is played on a fixed grid 10 x 10, where a  
player places game pieces called "ships". Ships are rectangles 1 x N with fixed counts of expected ships of each size N.  
Player arranges them arbitrarily, some horizontal and some vertical. Ships are not allowed to touch each other, either  
by sides or corners - there should be at least one empty space between them (note that this is different from popular  
rules of this game where ships can touch).

Players submit initial board position to your server. We don't trust client, it can be modified to win games unfairly or  
to hack into our server. We need to validate whether the submitted board is correct.

public record Ship(Integer x, Integer y, Boolean isHorizontal, Integer length) {}

As an input we are getting a list of ships.

Followups: What if we have constrains about how many ships of given len should be on board?  
Followups: What if board size can be changed?

This questionw was asked in a Google interview and I found it really interesting.

`We have a matrix of numbers. If we select a window inside the matrix, what would be the average of the numbers inside that window?`

```
Start with an infinite two dimensional grid filled with zeros, indexed from (1,1) at the bottom left corner with coordinates increasing toward the top and right. Given a series of coordinates (r,c) where r is the ending row and c is the ending column, add 1 to each element in the range from (1,1) to (r,c) inclusive. Once all coordinates are processed, determine how many cells contain the maximal value in the grid.

Example: upRight = ["1 4", "2 3", "4 1"]

The two space-separated integers within each string represent r and c respectively. The diagrams the attached images show each iteration starting at zero. The maximal value in the grid is 3, and there is 1 occurence at cell (1,1).

Complete a function countMax to return the number of occurrences of teh final grid's maximal element. countMax has the following parameter(s): string upRight[n]: an array of strings made of two space-seperated integers, r and c.

# Return
long : the number of occurrences of the final grid's maximal element.

# Constraints :

    1 ≤ n ≤ 100
	1 ≤ number of rows, number of columns ≤ 10^6
```
