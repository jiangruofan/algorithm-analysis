[Google | OA | Remove maximum edges](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2401866/Google-or-OA-or-Remove-maximum-edges)

**Problem statement:**

Given a tree with N nodes and N-1 edges. Each node has a value associated with it.  
You have to remove maximum number of edges such that the value of each resulted connected component is same.  
The value of a connected component is the sum of values of it's nodes.

**Note:**  Answer always exists as you can always remove zero edges, so that the whole tree remains connected.

  
**Input Format:**

First line contains integer N (number of nodes)  
Second line contains N integers, where ith integer is value of ith node.  
Next N-1 lines contains 2 integers u, v denoting there is an edge between node u and v of tree.

  
**Constraints:**

1 <= N <= 10^5  
1 <= a[i] <= 10^3

  
**Output:**

The maximum number of edges you can remove from the tree such that it holds the condition given in the problem.

  
**Example:**

Question 1:  
You are given an array of integers. Your task is to create pairs of them, such that every created pair has the same sum. This sum is not specified, but the number of created pairs should be the maximum possible. Each array element may belong to one pair only.

```
    Write a function:

```

class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum possible number of pairs with the same sum.

```
    Examples:

    1. Given A = [1, 9, 8, 100, 2], the function should return 2. The pairs are (A[0], A[1]) and (A[2], A[4]); the sum of each pair is 10.

    2. Given A = [2, 2, 2, 3], the function should return 1. Although, for instance, A[0]+A[1] = A[0]+A[2], the pairs (A[0], A[1]) and (A[0], A[2]) cannot exist at the same time, because they both contain a common element, A[0].

    3. Given A = [5, 5], the function should return 1.

    Assume that:

    N is an integer within the range [2..50];

    each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000].

    In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.

[Google Phone Interview](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1442346/Google-Phone-Interview)

This was the question asked at my recent Phone Interview with Google.  
Given a 2-D matrix that contains binary digits of 1's and 0's. Return the boundary coordinates of each region covered by 1's.

Example:

Input:

0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 1 1 0 1 1  
1 1 1 1 0 1  
0 1 1 0 1 1  
0 0 0 0 1 0

Output:

Here we have two region boundaries and they are marked with numbers 2 and 3.  
(For representation alone. The result should just be the boundary coordinates)

0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 2 2 0 3 3  
2 1 1 2 0 3  
0 2 2 0 3 3  
0 0 0 0 3 0

The expected output in this case is:  
Two regions boundary points.  
Region 1-  
[[1,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2],[2,3],  
Region 2-  
[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[3,4],[3,5],[4,4]]

The result should be a List containing the boundary coordinates marked with the numbers 2 and 3.

P.S: The region does not check for diagonal 1's. (It only considers top,bottom,right and left to mark the regions)

答案:
"The result should be a List containing the boundary coordinates marked with the numbers 2 and 3."

This makes it seem like they don't care if you distinguish between islands. If this is true, then this is pretty easy. You just have to iterate across all '1' cells and return the [i, j] index of any cell that is  _not_  completely surrounded by 1s in all four directions.

If they do care about distinguishing between islands, it's still not too bad - just do a regular island BFS/DFS, then remove any cell that is completely surrounded by 1s in all four directions. This effectively does the same thing as the solution above, but it gives you the cells separated by their island.

Essentially this question but a starting point is given.
So it is not the max possible length overall but max possible length from a given starting point
```

Given a 2d matrix, each element in this matrix is unique, i.e. in a matrix of m*n, it contains integers from 1,2,3,..m*n.  
Find the longest consecutive path in it. You could go in the four directions: right, left, up and down, no other directions allowed.

e.g.

in this matrix:

```
int[][] grid = new int[][]{
				{1,  2, 13,  5},
				{11, 10,  9,  6},
				{3,  4,  8,  7},
				{12, 14, 15, 16},

[Google | Onsite | Maximum number of orders from ribbon inventory](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1754070/Google-or-Onsite-or-Maximum-number-of-orders-from-ribbon-inventory)

You are given an integer array  `Inventories`  representing the ribbon inventories, where  `Inventories[i]`  represents the length of the  `ith`  ribbon, and an array of  `orders`. Each  `order`  in  `orders`  is an array of integers, representing the ribbons needed with certain lengths for that order. For example, if order = [1,2], then that means this order need a ribbon with length 1 and a ribbon with length 2. You may cut any of the ribbons  **in the inventory**  into any number of segments of positive integer lengths, or perform no cuts at all. However, you  **cannot**  combine two ribbons in the inventory to form a longer ribbon and fullfil an order. Each segment/ribbon in the inventory cannot be reused. The question is, what is the maximum number of orders that can be fulfilled?

Example 1:  
Input:  `Inventories = [1,8,7], orders = [[1, 2], [4, 3, 6]]`  
Output:  `2`  
Explanation:  
First cut inventories[1] into [2,6], then the inventory become [1, 7, 2, 6]. Use inventories[0] and inventories[2] for the first order. The rest of the inventories are [7,6], then cut the ribbon with the length of 7 into 4 and 3 to fulfill the second order. So in total 2 orders are fulfilled.

Example 2:  
Input:  `Inventories = [1,2,3], orders = [[3, 3], [4]]`  
Output:  `0`  
Explanation:  
None of the orders can be fulfilled. Notice we cannot combine inventories[0] and inventories[1] for orders[0].

Example 3:  
Input:  `Inventories = [3], orders = [[2]]`  
Output:  `1`  
Explanation:  
Cut the ribbon into 2 and 1, and use the first segment for that order.

I found this queston so hard that I cannot even come up with a solution better than bruteforce. Please forgive my poor English.

total = [] #表示所有的需要经过

    def dfs(node):

        return (-1, -1)
      x1, y1 = dfs(node.left)
      x2, y2 = dfs(node.right)
      if y1 == 0 or y2 == 0:
        total.append(node)
        return (1, -1)
      elif y1 == 1 or y2 == 1:
        if x1 == 1 or x2 == 1:
          return (0, -1)
        else:
          return(-1, 0)
      elif node.val == 1:
        if x1 == -1 and x2 == -1:
          return (-1, 1)
        else:
          return (0 if x1 == 1 or x2 == 1 else -1, -1)
      else:
        return (0 if x1 == 1 or x2 == 1 else -1, -1)
  
 return (x, y) 
这里的x表示当前节点或者下面节点的监控情况 如果是1 表示当前节点放一个摄像头 如果为0表示下面一层节点有一个摄像头 如果为-1 表示没有摄像头
这里的y表示当前硬币的距离 1表示当前节点是一个硬币 0表示下面一层存在一个硬币 -1表示没有硬币

 然后就是求连接total这些节点的最短路径加起来乘2
