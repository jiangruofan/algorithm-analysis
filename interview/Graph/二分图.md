[GOOGLE INTERVIEW QUESTION](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/800143/GOOGLE-INTERVIEW-QUESTION)

I was asked this question in my google interview. I was not able to solve it. Does someone has idea how to approch it?  
Car driver Allocation  
A car rental company has ‘m’ drivers at a particular time and each driver can drive only certain types of vehicles out of the given ‘n’ vehicles. The manager has been kind enough to put together this information as a neat bipartite graph:

The edge represents the ability of the driver to drive the vehicle the edge is connected to. For example, driver d1 is able to drive vehicle v1 and v3, but not the other kinds of vehicles.  
The next job is to assign exactly one driver to one vehicle, so that no driver is assigned two (or more) vehicles, and nor is one vehicle assigned two (or more) drivers. We want to find the maximum number of such assignments at a time.

An instance of such an arrangement with maximum edges is given below, with the blue edges representing an assignment. Here, the number of edges in the arrangement is 3:

You are given the below program that takes a bipartite graph as input and gives the maximum possible number of edges in such a one-to-one assignment of the left and right vertices of the given bipartite graph.

[Google L4 Phone Interview](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2595546/Google-L4-Phone-Interview)

```
If you are given a list of questions and list of volunteers , find the maximum number of questions that can be answered

Ex: Questions```
{
{
"id":"1"
"question":"what is hello world"
"tags": ["ai, "python"]
}

{
	"id":"2"
	"question":"help with this"
	"tags": ["ai, "netowrking"]
}

{
	"id":"3"
	"question":"Why is String immutable ?"
	"tags": ["java"]
}
}

volunteers {
{
"id":"raj"
"tags": ["ai, "python"]
}

{
	"id":"hero"
	"tags": ["ai, "netowrking"]
}

{
	"id":"mark"
	"tags": ["cp"]
}
}

result : {
{
"question1":"volunteer1"
}
{
"question2":"volunteer3"
}
}




A volunteer can answer question if he/she as matching tags as that of question. Dont remember exact example set but problem statement is the same. 

Solution: I could not come up with proper solution as I built map of tag to Questions and volunteer mapping and then iterated through each tag to assign next available volunteer to question and finall return result

How do I proceed to get optimal solution

[Microsoft Codility Online Assessment NOV 2022 3h 4 Questions](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2778329/Microsoft-Codility-Online-Assessment-NOV-2022-3h-4-Questions)

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/2a324405-0b5d-42b3-9a77-6a9a5e1ae831_1669425733.5948157.jpeg)

1.  There are N patients (numbered from 0 to n — 1) who want to visit the doctor. The doctor has S possible appointment slots, numbered from 1 to S. Each of the patients has two preferences. Patient K would like to visit the doctor during either slot A[k] or slot B[k]. The doctor can treat only one patient during each slot.  
    Is it possible to assign every patient to one of their preferred slots so that there will be at most one patient assigned to each slot?  
    Write a function:  `class Solution { public boolean solution (int [] A, int[] B, int S); }`  
    that, given two arrays A and B, both of N integers, and an integer S, returns  _**true**_  if it is possible to assign every patient to one of their preferred slots, one patient to one slot, and  _**false**_  otherwise.
    
    -   Given A = [1, 1, 3], B = [2, 2, 1] and S = 3, the function should return  _true_.
    -   Given A = [3, 2, 3, 1], B = [1, 3, 1, 2] and S = 3, the function should return  _false_.
    -   Given A = [1, 2, 1, 6, 8, 7, 8], B = [2, 3, 4, 7, 7, 8, 7] and S = 10, the function should return  _false_.

首先如果存在slot只对应一个病人 那么最好 不然的话就是只能一个slot对应两个病人  如果出现一个slot对应两个以上病人 那么直接返回false
