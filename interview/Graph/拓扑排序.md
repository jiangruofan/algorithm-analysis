You are given a course prerequisites list in the form {(a,b),(c,d)...}. A semester is a unit where you can take one or multiple courses. To take a course in a semester, you must complete all the prerequisite courses of that course. You need to find minimum number of semesters required to complete all the courses of the curriculum.  
(a,b) -> course a is prerequisite to take course b.  
Example: Given (1,2) (1,5) (5,2) (2,3) (2,4) (4,6) (5,6) the answer is 5./Which means you need can complete the curriculum in 5 semesters.

Write a function that will give you a list of recipes you can prepare with a given list of ingredients.

eg: to prepare BREAD, you need Flour and Yeast  
Intermediate Ingredient: NONE

Ham and Cheese  
Raw Ingredients: Ham, Cheese  
Intermediate Ingredient: BREAD

Caprese Salad: Mozzrela, Tomatoes  
Intermediate Ingredient: NONE

if you have Ham, Cheese, Flour, Yeast - your function should return BREAD and HaM and Cheese. Create, write your own data structire, function signature.

[Google | L5 SDE | Assessment question](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2535666/Google-or-L5-SDE-or-Assessment-question)

we're trying to create a library resolver. So, lets say we want to download tesla-client. But, this library requires tesla-common, tesla-ui and tesla-http to be downloaded first. and then tesla-common requires junit, tesla-http requires http-client, etc, etc...

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/fc1e3f1d-9a01-4be5-ba74-d4bb402c72ec_1662396425.7665935.png)

Constraints:

each library takes n miliseconds to complete download. tesla-client takes 7ms, tesla-http takes 12ms, and so on

we can download x libraries at the same time simultaneously

if there are more available libraries for download than download quota, then always prioritize on library whose name is alphabetically smallest. Example: we can only download 3 libraries in parallel, and we have http-core, tesla-cols, tesla-rows and junit eligible to download at any given time, then we'll download http-core, junit and tesla-cols first.

it is guaranteed that the structure will always be a tree, without cycle, no multiple parent

```
public int getMaxTime(int maxDownload, AdjacencyList adjList){
	//need to implement this 
}

```

Given these constraints, is there a clever and efficient way to find out the fastest time needed to download all libraries? none of traversal algo would work due to x simultaneous download restriction.

答案: 拓扑排序+heap
维护一个heap 保存所有的available的元素
维护一个长度为x的heap 记录的是所有的正在处理的元素 然后从小到大弹出 每次弹出都从available的heap取出元素并加入

The topological sort question was: Given a set of rules such as:  
"Object 1 is placed to the left of Object 2", "Object 4 is placed to the right of Object 2".  
Print a left to right placement of all objects. So [Object 1, Object 2, Object 4]  
To solve, construct a Directed graph and do a topological sort.

[Google | Marathon](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/355686/Google-or-Marathon)

`n`  students  `[0, ..., n-1]`  participate in a marathon. You are given an int array  `standings`  where  `standings[i] = j`  means that student  `j`  finished just before student  `i`.  `standings[k] = -1`  means that  `k`  is the first student. There are no ties. List out the students in the order in which they finished the marathon.

**Example:**

```
Input: [-1, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 1, 2]

```

**Follow-up:**  
There are ties.

**Example:**

```
Input: [-1, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 1, 2]
```

Below is a coding problem I was asked during a Google technical phone screen:

**Question:**  Convert an array of email folder objects to an array of Gmail label strings.

```
// Sample input:

folders = [
    {id: 27, parentId: 15, name: 'projects'},
    {id: 81, parentId: 27, name: 'novel'},
    {id: 15, parentId: 0, name: 'personal'}, // a parentId of 0 means root

    'personal/projects',
    'personal/projects/novel',
    'personal',
    'personal/projects/blog',
]
