In an auditorium, the lighting system of N bulbs is placed in a row. Due to some technical fault in the power supply, only some of the bulbs remain ON and the rest of them go OFF. Due to this flaw in the network, the bulbs which are OFF are unable to work. So till the technical team finds the actual cause of the fault, the technical head Akshay makes some temporary arrangements for the OFF bulbs at a minimum cost. Akshay decides to connect all the OFF bulbs to the nearby ON bulbs so that the length of the cable used to connect them is minimum. He calculates the distance of the systems from the first system.

Write an algorithm to help Akshay find the minimum length of the cable used to turn all the bulbs ON.

Input

The first line of the input consists of an integral num, representing the number of bulbs (N).  
The second line consists of N space-separated integers representing the initial state of each bulb, ON(1) or OFF(0)  
The last line consists of N space-separated integers representing the distance of the bulbs from the first bulb.  
Output

Print an integer representing the minimum length of the cable used to turn all the bulbs ON.  
Example

Input:  
3  
1 0 0  
1 5 6  
Output:  
5  
Explanation:

Length of the cable required to connect the 2nd bulb to the 1st bulb =4  
Length of the cable required to connect the 3rd bulb to the 2nd bulb =1  
The total length of the cable = 5(4+1)  
So, the output is 5.

[Uber OA | 6 Month Internship | 2023 | Off Campus](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2624313/Uber-OA-or-6-Month-Internship-or-2023-or-Off-Campus)

You are the mayor of a very old city. The city has  `n`  major tourist attractions. You are given the locations  `(x, y, z)`  for each of these tourist attractions.

To boost the tourism in your city, you plan to create new roads that connect the tourist attractions.

To create a bidirectional road between tourist attraction A (located at (x1, y1, z1) ) and B (located at (x2, y2, z2) ), you need to spend min ( |x1 - x21 , ly1 y21, 1z1 - z21) dollars. Here |x1 - x2| refers to the absolute value of x1 - ×2, and min(*, y, z) refers to the minimum value out of x, y and z.

**You need to create a network of roads such that it is possible to travel between  
any pair of tourist attractions using some sequence of roads**. What is the minimum amount of dollars you need to spend in order to accomplish this task?

**Sample Input**

```
``n = 3``

``locations = 

[[1, 5, 7],
[2, 9, 4],
[1, 3, 9]]

```

**Expected Output**

```
1

```

**Explanation**

```
We can create 2 roads -
	1. Road connecting attraction 1 (at (1, 5, 7)) and attraction 3 (at (1, 3, 9). The cost
		of creating this road is min ( | 1 - 1 |, | 5 - 3 |, |7 - 9 |) = min (0, 2, 2) = 0.
	2. Road connecting attraction 1 (at (1; 5, 7)) and attraction 2 (at (2, 9, 4)). The cost
		of creating this road is min (1 1 - 2 |, | 5 - 9 |, 17 - 4 |) = min (1,4,3) = 1.
Creating these two roads enables us to travel between any pair of tourist attractions.
The total cost of creating these roads is 1 dollar.

```

-   **[execution time limit] 1 seconds (cpp)**
    
    The number of major tourist attractions in the city.
    
    1 <= n <= 100000
    
-   **[input] array.array.integer.locations**
    
    A matrix consisting of  `n`  rows. Each row has 3 integers - xi, Yi, zi - which describe the location of the  `i th`  attraction.
    
    All coordinates are integers, and  
    -100000 <- Xi, Yi, Zi <= 100000 forall i.
    
-   **[output] integer64**
    
    The minimum amount in dollars that you need to spend in order to build the road  
    network.
