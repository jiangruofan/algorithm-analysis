[OA - Hackerrank - Balancing Scale](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2623521/OA-Hackerrank-Balancing-Scale)

Given the number of objects (p) and a list of weight comparisions (q), For any object m & n, return the heavier object ? If it is not possible to derive a soln for given m & n, print "-1"  
Example :

```
p = 5
q = 2
[1,2] : Implies that 1 > 2
[2,3] : Implies that 2 > 3

m = 1
n = 3

Expected output : 

1
Since 1>2>3 => 1>3

```

The coding challenge was only for 25 mins and I was unable to crack the logic.

答案:
1. offline  预处理所有query放入双重词典那么直接dfs即可 把路径用set保存下来 往下传递 给定一个节点 那么直接看它的query有哪些 是否在set里面
2. 最近公共祖先
