You are given an array A of size N.

Let us define F(i,j,k) as the following:  
F(i,j,k) (Ai | Aj) & Ak Here | is bitwise or operator, & is bitwise and operator.  
Determine bitwise XOR of F(A, B, C) over all triplets (A, B, C) such that  
1< A, B, C ≤N.

Example 1:  
Assumptions  
N=2  
A = [1, 4]  
Approach:

The triplets are as follows:  
F(1, 1, 1) = 1 F(1, 1, 2) = 0 F(1, 2, 1) = 1 F(1, 2, 2) = 4 F(2, 1, 1) = 1 F(2, 1,2) = 4 F(2, 2, 1) = 0 F(2, 2, 2) = 4  
Bitwise XOR of all triplets = 10^1^4^1^0^4=5  
Therefore, the answer is 5.

Example 2:  
N=1  
A = [5]  
Approach

There is only triplet possible F(1, 1, 1) = 5  
Bitwise XOR of all triplets = 5  
Therefore the answer is 5.

Anyone can come up with the code?
