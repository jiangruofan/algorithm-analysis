You are given an array A of size N.

Let us define F(i,j,k) as the following:  
F(i,j,k) (Ai | Aj) & Ak Here | is bitwise or operator, & is bitwise and operator.  
Determine bitwise XOR of F(A, B, C) over all triplets (A, B, C) such that  
1< A, B, C ≤N.

Example 1:  
Assumptions  
N=2  
A = [1, 4]  
Approach:

The triplets are as follows:  
F(1, 1, 1) = 1 F(1, 1, 2) = 0 F(1, 2, 1) = 1 F(1, 2, 2) = 4 F(2, 1, 1) = 1 F(2, 1,2) = 4 F(2, 2, 1) = 0 F(2, 2, 2) = 4  
Bitwise XOR of all triplets = 10^1^4^1^0^4=5  
Therefore, the answer is 5.

Example 2:  
N=1  
A = [5]  
Approach

There is only triplet possible F(1, 1, 1) = 5  
Bitwise XOR of all triplets = 5  
Therefore the answer is 5.

Anyone can come up with the code?

答案: 统计所有数字在32位上的个数 然后就是遍历Ak 因为是&运算符所以只需要考虑Ak的各位为1的情况 时间复杂度是O(32n)

[CodeSignal | OA | Count number of pairs that differ by just one digit](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2719588/CodeSignal-or-OA-or-Count-number-of-pairs-that-differ-by-just-one-digit)

```
Given an array of numbers count the number of pairs where the two numbers differ by exactly one digit.
Ex: numbers = [1,1,9,151,351,22, 241]
output = 3
(1,9), (1,9), (151, 351)

```

Constraints:

```
where n is the length of the array
1 <= n <= 10^4
1 <= a[i] <= 10^9
```

[Nuro | Phone Screen | Generate string with replacements](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2723946/Nuro-or-Phone-Screen-or-Generate-string-with-replacements)

Given a string, say `abc`, generate all possible strings by replacing characters with a `1`. And add consecutive `1`s in the generated strings. So for the given string, the generated set of strings would be  
`['abc', 'ab1', 'a1c', 'a2', '1bc', '1b1', '2c', '3']`  
**Constraints**:  
Input string length is <= 9  
**Example:**  
Input: `test`  
Output: `['test', 'tes1', 'te1t', 'te2', 't1st', 't1s1', 't2t', 't3', '1est', '1es1', '1e1t', '1e2', '2st', '2s1', '3t', '4']`
