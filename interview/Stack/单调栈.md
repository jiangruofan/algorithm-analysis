#### [2345. Finding the Number of Visible Mountains](https://leetcode.cn/problems/finding-the-number-of-visible-mountains/)

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array peaks where peaks[i] = [xi, yi] states that mountain i has a peak at coordinates (xi, yi). A mountain can be described as a right-angled isosceles triangle, with its base along the x-axis and a right angle at its peak. More formally, the gradients of ascending and descending the mountain are 1 and -1 respectively.

A mountain is considered visible if its peak does not lie within another mountain (including the border of other mountains).

Return the number of visible mountains.

[Atlassian | OA | Ball Collision](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2704307/Atlassian-or-OA-or-Ball-Collision)

There are n balls placed on a 1-dimensional axis with each of them moving with same non zero speed. direction[i] represents the direction in which the ith ball is moving,with -1 meaning that it is moving to left and 1 meaning that it is moving to right. The strength of ith ball is described by by strength[i]. If 2 balls collide, the one with higher strength destroys the smaller one. If both have same strength, both are destroyed. Return a list of the indices of the ball that remain after all the collisions have occured n ascending order

Note that arrays direction and strength are 0-indexed

**Example**  
direction = [1,-1]  
strength = [2,1]

The number of balls n=2. The balls are listed in order of occurence from left to  [right.so](http://right.so/)  ball 0 is somewhere to left of the ball 1. ball 0 is moving to the right and ball 1 is moving to the left. The balls will collide at some point and the ball with higher strength, ball 0, remains. Return[0] as the answer

**Constraints:**  
1 <= n <= 10^5  
direction[i] is either -1 or 1  
1 <= strength[i] <= 10^9

**Sample case 0:**  
3 //value of n  
1 -1 1 //direction[i]  
5 3 1 //strength[i]  
**output:**  
0 2  
**Explanation:**  
The first and Third balls are moving right and the second ball is moving left. The first and second balls will collide at some point and the ball with higher strength, ball 0,remains.  
The third ball doesnt collide with any other ball

**Sample case 1:**  
2  
1 1  
3 4  
**output:**  
0 1  
**Explanation:**  
Both balls are moving to right with same speed, so no collision
