[Google | Algorithm](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/810747/Google-or-Algorithm)

Given a very large 2D character matrix of dimensions N x N (Here N is very large - of the order of 100000s)

For example, consider the below matrix:

a b c  
d e f  
g h i

If we print this matrix diagonally, then the output is:  
a b d c e g f h i

We also have a stream of short strings (each of the strings have length S)  
s0, s1, s2,...

say S = 3 and the stream has the following strings:  
abc, abd, gfh

Tell an efficient algorithm to tell which of the strings in this stream of strings occur in this diagonal traversal of this character matrix.
