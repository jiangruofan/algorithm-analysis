Given a List of events with  `start_time`  and  `end_time`. of connections Find the hour in which we have most number of active connections.

Example:

```
Input: YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS
List<start_time, end_time> connections
Input: [[1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 3]]
Answer: 2 (Hour 2 has most active connections) 

```

Follow up:

-   Suppose the list is huge and is distributed accross mutliple machine. How would you process it?

PS. I am more interested in knowing solution/approaches for the follow-up.

排个序 碰到开始+1 结束-1 
follow up就是k个生序链表 用heap做
