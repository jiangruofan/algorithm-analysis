Given an array (treat it as a circular array) and a value k  
partition it into k sequencial parts such that difference between sum of this min part and max part is minimum.  
We just have to return that minimum difference.

Example1: [6,13,10,2] , k=2  
Ans:5 ---> Parts are [13] [6,10,2] Note array is cicular :P and difference of sum is 18-13=5

Example2: [6,13,2,10] , k=2  
Ans: 1

Example3: [6,13,10,2] k=4  
Ans : 11

[Microsoft | Phone Screen | Validates Excel Input](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1714708/Microsoft-or-Phone-Screen-or-Validates-Excel-Input)

I was asked the question during a Phone Screen Interview, it was written in a PDF, the description didn't make any sense to me, so I had to ask a lot of questions for the clarification.

Write a program that validates Excel inputs:

```
A1: Tiger |  B1: A2   | C1: B2 | D1: Lion | E1: A1 + B1 + C1 + D1
A2: runs  |  B2: with | C2:    | D2:      |

Output: Tiger runs with Lion
True 
Because the cell of E1 has non-empty values or reference of non-empty values.

```

```
A1: Tiger |  B1: A2   | C1: B2 | D1: Lion | E1: A1 + B1 + C2 + D2
A2: runs  |  B2: with |

Output: Tiger runs C2(no value) D2(no value)
False 
Because in the cell of E1, both C2 and D2 don't have any values.

```

I thought image makes more sense:  
Case One is valid because every cell has value or value refers to the other cel:
