[Google | Phone Screening | Google Photos Client](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2072005/Google-or-Phone-Screening-or-Google-Photos-Client)

**Problem statement:**  
Suppose you are working on Google Photos. you are wring the client application. Request comes to you to upload N photos. you fire the request to server to upload those N photos to server. Then the server responds back with acknowledgements that a particular photo is uploaded.  
Example. Suppose you are uploading 10 Photos, The server can respond back in any order, such as 1,2,4,5,3,7,6,10,9,8 . Now at any given point of time we need to check what is the maximum photo number which has been uploaded continously.  
**Example**.

ack(1),  
getMax()-> returns 1, because the maximum photo uploaded is 1  
ack(2),  
getMax()-> returns 2, because the maximum photo uploaded is 2  
ack(4)  
getMax()-> returns 2 only because 3 has not been recieved yet  
ack(5)  
getMax()-> returns 2 again because 3 has not been recieved yet  
ack(3)  
getMax()-> returns 5 because we recieved 3 and 4 and 5 also we recieved eralier. using this example you have to complete the following class

没必要用有序集合维护
```
class PhotosClient:
    # Initializer
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.photos = set()
        self.ptr = 1

    # This method is called each time you receive acknowledgement from the server.
    def ack(self, x):
        photos, ptr = self.photos, self.ptr
        self.photos.add(x)
        while ptr in photos:
            ptr += 1
        self.ptr = ptr

    # This method will be called in between to check what the maximum photo number has been uploaded successfully
    def getMax(self):
        return self.ptr - 1
```

I got asked one very weird question in Google OA last month and I still dont have answer for it. Question was to compress string, like AABBBC  
to A2B3C. But here is the catch, the input is too big that you cant fit it in your system stack. Any pointers ?  
This is for backend role btw.  
Further discussion :  
1)They said that user in entering very big string but you cant store the whole input because it exceeds your system stack. So , you have to somehow keep taking input and handle it gracefully as well as compress it. Can i assume it is stored in some file ? Interviewer : No.

https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1880511/Google-or-Onsite
I had a phone interview with Google recently  
Question:  
Given the user and there posts, maximize the likes of N posts where N appears atleast N times.  
For eg. Consider likes = [8,6,5,5,2,1] Output: 4 (Because there are 4 post with 4 likes. )  
Explaination: 8 contains 4 likes, 6 contains 4 likes,5 contains 4 likes,5 contains 4 likes and more importantly number of posts are 4  
2. likes = [1,2,2] Output 2 (Because there are 2 post with 2 likes)  
3. likes = [1,3,4,2] Output 2(Because there are 2 post with 2 likes)

[Facebook | Phone | Friend Suggestion](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/486188/Facebook-or-Phone-or-Friend-Suggestion)
This was from January 2020, and was asked in Facebook during a Phone Iterview. In addition, other friends of mine also reported to have seen this same question in Google as well.

Suppose you have a small, in-memory, social network and each person registered in it is modelled as follow:

`Person: {int id, Set<Integer> friends}`

Now code a method  `public Person friendSuggestion(Person p)`  which will return the person that has most in friends in common with the input  _'p'_. In case multiple people have the same number of friends in common, return any one of them. And in case there is no person to return, then NULL should be the answer.

Suppose the following scenario:

Person A: [B, C]  
Person B: [A, D, E]  
Person C: [A, D, F]  
Person D: [B, C, E]  
Person E: [B, D, F]  
Person F: [C, E]

When we call  `friendSuggestion(A)`  it will return  _Person D_.

答案:
Go over all friends of p and for every friend x, visit x's friend list and count frequency of each friend seen. At the end, return the highest frequency count friend.

Hello,

Recently I appeared for telephonic round with Google and here is the question. I tried to come up with backtracking solution. Could someone please let me know of a better solution?

Question - You need to generate all 16 digit numbers such that the following conditions are satisfied by all those numbers -

1.  The odd numbered positions in such a number must be a prime digit.
2.  The even numbered positions in such a number must be an even digit.

Example - Since its a 16 digit number (0-indexed) , one such valid number could be 0223456782032547. In this 16 digit number all the digits in even position (position no. starting from 0) have even digit and all the digits in odd position (position no. starting from 1) have prime digit.

Design and build a moving average stock data stream class, which implements the moving average of a stock symbol and price. The average will be defined as the user of the data stream. The moving average should be the average of the last N in the data stream.

Example: StockSymbolMovingAverage stockSymbolMovingAverage = new StockSymbolMovingAverage (3) → Follow up where he added two number (3 ,4)  
StockSymbolMovingAverage.next(“SPY”, 1) //<1,1>  
StockSymbolMovingAverage.next(“Amazon”, 10) //10  
StockSymbolMovingAverage.next(“SPY” 10) // (1+10)/2 = 5.5 <5.5, 5.5>  
StockSymbolMovingAverage.next(“SPY” 3) // (1+10+3) /3= <4.67, 4.67>  
StockSymbolMovingAverage.next(“SPY” 5) // (1 + 1 (10 + 3 + 5))/[3,4] = <6, 4.75>

This is similar to moving average from data stream question and product of the last k-numbers question but this is taking in  **two numbers**  ( stockSymbolMovingAverage = new StockSymbolMovingAverage (3,4)) and when called .next fuction it is taking in  **string and integer.**

You are a museum curator. The museum has sculptures and paintings. You are hosting a lazy king who is only interested in scultpures, but the paintings block his view. Your task is to write best spots for him to stand on. The best spot is the most number of scultpures king can see north,south,east or west . The king can see everything until he sees a painting which blocks his view.

your input is

```
   <<height, width of room>
    <painting1 x, y location>
    ...
    <paintingN x,y location>
    <scultpure1 x,y location>
    ...
    <scultputreN x,y location>

```

For example with input

```
<5,5>
<scultpure 2,1>
<scultpure 2,3 >
<scultpure 2,4>
<scultpure 0,4>

```

Output is  `2,0 and 2,2`

There can be 0 to M_N (where M is height N is width) paintings/scultpures in a room. Total number of paintings + scultpures can not be more than M_N.

[Google | DSA island problem](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2545702/Google-or-DSA-island-problem)

Given a 2D matrix of numbers where 0 represents sea and 1 represents land.  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1  
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1  
0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0

0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0  
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Calculate the maximum distance of any point on land from the sea and return that number. The movement can be left, right, up, down. The movement cannot be diagonal.  
So in the example above, the answer is 3, which is the distance of the middle bold point on land from sea.

I attempted this using a BFS approach but it had multiple issues.  
Later got to know that this was to be solved via DFS and I screwed up, was rejected in that round.

Any ideas how this can be solved with DFS? Thanks.

[Capital One | OA | 2022](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2620822/Capital-One-or-OA-or-2022)

Imagine there is a circle of red and blue tiles. The color of the tiles are represented by the array tileColors, where tileColors[i] = 0 means that the ith tile is red, whereas tileColors[i] = 1 means that the ith tile is blue.

We want to determine whether the tiles that are next to each other in the circle have alternating colors - the ith tile should have a different color than both the i+1th and the i-1th neighboring tiles . Given an integer size, we want to know how many groups of size consecutive tiles have alternating colors.

Note that because tileColors represents a circle, the first and last tiles (elements in the array) are considered to be next to each other.

Example:  
For tileColors = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] and size = 3, the output should be solution(tileColors, size) = 3.

Explanation:  
There are five unique subarrays of size 3.  
First: tileColors[0...2] = [0, 1, 0], which has alternating colors;  
Second: tileColors[1...3] = [1, 0, 1], which has alternating colors;  
Third: tileColors[2...4] = [0, 1, 1], which does not have alternating colors;  
Fourth: tileColors[3...4] + tileColors[0] = [1, 1, 0] (+ is the array concatenation operation), which does not have alternating colors;  
Fifth: tileColors[4] + tileColors[0...1] = [1, 0, 1], which has alternating colors;  
So, there are 3 subarrays which have alternating colors.

[Microsoft Online Assessment Question](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2623065/Microsoft-Online-Assessment-Question)

This is one of the problems for Microsoft Online Assessements

You are given an array S consisting of N strings. Every string is of the same length M. Your task is to find a pair of strings in array S, such that there exists a position in which both of the strings have the same letter. Both the index in array S and the positions in the strings are numbered from zero.

For example, given  **S = ["abc", "bca", "dbe"]**, string 0 ("abc") and string 2 ("dbe") have the same letter 'b' in position 1. On the other hand, for strings "abc" and "bca" there does not exist a position in which they have the same letter.

Write a function that, given a zero-indexed array S of N strings, returns an array describing a pair of strings from S which share a common letter at some index. If there is no such pair, the function should return an empty array. If there is more than one correct answer, the function can return any of them.

The result should be represented as an array containing three integers. The first two integers are the indexes in S of the strings belonging to the pair. The third integer is the position of the common letter.

For  **S = ["abc", "bca", "dbe"]**, as above, the result array should be represented as [0, 2, 1]. Another correct answer is [2, 0, 1], as the order of indexes of strings does not matter.

Thanks for sharing the wiki link... during the OA my mind was blowing of how to do it with a TC better than n^2..
Actually I tried with n^2 at last during OA and it passed all the test cases so maybe either it was a typo or they were just trying to crack a joke
That is a really bad joke. If  `O(N^2)`  solution passes, they should make the constraint at most 3000, not 100000.  
The constraint for  `t`  is also intriguing to me, as it doesn't fit into an  `int`.

I would have also tried for the  `O(N^2)`  too because there doesn't exist a better solution than that time complexity wise, but it is definitely going to trip some people over.

[Roblox Karat Interview](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/872735/Roblox-Karat-Interview)

This was for an mid-level role at Roblox.

1.  Find the top left and bottom right coordinates of a rectangle of 0's within a matrix of 1's. It's essentially a modified version of the finding the number of island problem where you only need to dfs to the right and down.  
    Ex.  
    [[ 1, 1, 1, 1],  
    [ 1,  **0**, 0, 1],  
    [ 1, 0,  **0**, 1],  
    [ 1, 1, 1, 1]]  
    Expected output: [[1,1], [2,2]]
    
2.  Follow up question: Expand it so it works for any number of rectangles. I ran out of time to code this part so get throught the first part quickly. Main part of this problem is updating how results are stored and tracking what's been seen.  
    Ex.  
    [[**0**, 1, 1, 1],  
    [1,  **0**, 0, 1],  
    [1, 0,  **0**, 1],  
    [1, 1, 1, 1]]  
    Expected output: [ [[0,0],[0,0]], [[1,1], [2,2]] ]

Technical Interview: I got 2 of them.

-   First interview, I got a graph, start, and destination point. Each node had a value of length. I had to find the shortest path to the destination. Also, There was an infected node with a virus and the path wouldn't work if I get to that node. In addition, the infected node had a virality, meaning that all the neiborghs connected to this infected node would get infected as well depending on the value of this virality. Ex, if virality is 2 all the first and second neiborghs connected to this infected node would get infected so that we can't use them on our possible paths. To solve this question I had to get a good understanding of Breath First Search in a graph so Dijkstra's Algorithm would be great.
-   Second Interview: This one was easier, I just got an input of workers with start and end hours. I had to order this data in periods of hours that do not overlap.  
    Ex.  
    Input:  
    Matt start: 3 end: 8

## Q4: Number of pairs of given diff in queries

-   Date: Aug. 22, 2022
-   Job title: Summer 2023 Software Engineer Intern
-   Difficulty: Hard
-   Author: Southisland

Given an empty array that should contain integers numbers, your task is to process a list of queries on it. Specifically, there are two types of queries:

-   "+x" - add number x to numbers. numbers may contain multiple instances of the same integer.
-   "-x" - remove all the instances of number x from numbers

After processing each query, record the number of pairs in numbers with a difference equal to a given diff. The final output should be an array of such values for all queries.

Notes:

-   All numbers in queries are guaranteed to be in the range of [-109, 109]. It is also guaranteed that for every "-x" query, the specified number x exists in numbers.  
    It is guaranteed that the answer for each query fits into a 32-bit integer type.

Examples:

-   For queries = ["+4", "+5", "+2", "-4"] and diff = 1, the output should be solution(queries, diff) = [0, 1, 1, 0].
-   For queries = ["+2", "+2", "+4", "+3", "-2"] and diff = 1, the output should be solution(queries, diff) = [0, 0, 0, 3, 1].

Input/Output:

-   1 ≤ queries.length ≤ 105.
-   1 ≤ diff ≤ 109.
-   the number will fit into a 32-bit integer

Write a function  _solution_  that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns the maximum number of letters 'a' that can be inserted into S (including at the front and end of S) so that the resulting string doesn't contain three consecutive letters 'a'. If string S already contains the substring "aaa", then you function should return -1.  
    Examples:
    
    -   S = "aabab", the function should return 3, because a string "aabaabaa" can be made.
    -   S = "baaaa", the function should return -1, because there is a substring "aaa".
    -   S = "aa", the function should return 0, because no longer string can be made.

[Song recommended System](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2778911/Song-recommended-System)

I had this interview question that need to recommend song  
Question:  
the historical data  
User 1 has liked A, B, C, D  
User 2 has liked A, C, D  
User 3 has liked B, C, E

Now we have a user that liked C, D  
As user1 and user 2 both like C and D, so their liked song will be recommend.  
The system should recommend the user song A, B  
( A should appear first, as user1 and user2 both liked A)

My solution (I didn't solve it):  
Using Two hashmap  
Map 1 <K, V> -> <User Name, likedSong list>  
Loop through user and find the overlapping with input user's song  
-> get the users that shared common interest

Map 2 <K, V> -> <Song Name, Count>  
Loop through common users and check the repeat time of each song

I didn't have enough time to solve this problem, but I think the rest is to use PriorityQueue to get the order of the song.

Does anyone come up better idea?

[Google | Phone | Minimum Domino Rotations For Target Value](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2786265/Google-or-Phone-or-Minimum-Domino-Rotations-For-Target-Value)

John is very fond of his domino set. Due to his friends' lack of interest in the game, he has had to invent a new version of the game that he can play on his own. His latest favorite domino game has very simple rules. First, John places domino tiles vertically, close to each other, so that he can easily distinguish the upper and lower parts of each tile. Then he picks number K. Now, he has to find the minimal number of rotations needed to obtain a sum of at least K dots in all upper panels.

Write a function:

`class Solution { public int solution(int[] A, int[] B, int K); }`

that, given two arrays, A and B, each containing N integers, denoting the counts of the dots on both ends of the N domino tiles (A[0] and B[0] describe the first domino tile, A[1] and B[1] describe the second domino tile, etc.), returns the minimal number of rotations needed to obtain a sum of at least K dots in A. If it is not possible to obtain a sum of at least K, your function should return −1.

For example, given: A = [2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1], B = [3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 4] and K = 19 your function should return 3 because you can rotate the first, fourth and sixth tiles, so that A will be equal to [3, 3, 1, 6, 2, 4] and the sum of its elements is 19.

Given A = [1, 2, 1, 2], B = [3, 4, 1, 2] and K = 20 your function should return −1.

[Help with question on object collisions](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2787117/Help-with-question-on-object-collisions)

Let's imagine objects located on the canvas at a certain moment in time. You are given an array of integer pairs centers representing the coordinates of those objects. Each object has a collision box - a square area around its center with a side equal to 2. Two objects are supposed to collide if their collision boxes have at least one common point. Calculate the number of object pairs that collide.

The example of the object located in coordinates [1, 1] can be represented as following:
![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/afeeb3f2-be98-4815-83b7-43463f4970c0_1667792222.1233017.png)
Where the green square is the collision box.

Note

Object collision boxes intersect if the distance in each coordinate between the object centers does not exceed 2.

If x1, y1 are coordinates of one object and x2, y2 are coordinates of the second object, then the collision condition for them can be written in the form |x[j] - x[i]| <= 2 and |y[j] - y[i]| <= 2.

Really struggled with this one, was thinking about hashing x values to the index of their y, and then just checking each adjacent x val's y vals for the condition, maybe keeping a set of pairs already checked. Would love any help on a solution! Test is over, I just want to understand. Thanks!

[Code Challenge](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2790184/Code-Challenge)

You are working on implementing a module for statistical analysis. You are given a list of numbers,  
where every i-th number represents a number of unique visitors for your website for i-th minute. Due  
to some hardware issues it might happen that a number of visitors for a certain minute cannot be  
determined, and thus a number representing that minute will be null. A non-empty continuous period  
of time for which a number of visitors for each minute was determined is called a Monitoring Window.  
A Monitoring Window which is not contained in any other Monitoring Window is called an Interesting  
Monitoring Window (IMW). You need to design and implement a utility class(es) providing the following  
functionality.  
The maxSum function should return a sub-list of a given list corresponding to an IMW with a maximum  
number of visitors determined. If there is more than one such IMW that exists, this function should  
return the longest one.  
The minAvg function should return a sub-list of a given list corresponding to an IMW with a lowest  
average number of visitors. If there is more than one such IMW that exists, this function should return  
the earliest one.  
If it’s not possible to find a required sub-list, both functions should return an empty list.  
Example:  
 maxSum(1, 5, null, 1, 2, 2, null, 3) → [1, 5]  
 minAvg(1, 5, null, 1, 2, 2, null, 3) → [1, 2, 2]  
There are 10 Monitoring Windows: [1], [5], [1, 5], [1], [2], [2], [1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 2, 2], [3],  
but there are only 3 IMVs: [1, 5], [1, 2, 2], [3].

[Google First Round: Format a list of strings into a table](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2841241/Google-First-Round:-Format-a-list-of-strings-into-a-table)

Format a list of strings into a table.

We have a style guide (for example, lines must be at most 80 characters wide). We have a tool that automatically  
formats code to the style guide. One thing it can do is arrange lists of strings into a table. The strings in  
each column are left-aligned to be more easily readable. It leaves no holes in the table except after the last  
string in the last row (i.e. every cell contains a string, except possibly in the last row). Of course, the  
strings remain in the original order.

Example:

W = 70 (characters)  
S = [IsAudioBuffer, GetTimestamp, SetTimestamp, GetSampleRate, GetSampleSize, GetNumberOfChannels,  
GetNumberOfSamples, GetDataBuffer, GetChannel]

We can format this as follows:

```
IsAudioBuffer   GetTimestamp        SetTimestamp       GetSampleRate    |
GetSampleSize   GetNumberOfChannels GetNumberOfSamples GetDataBuffer    |
GetChannel                                                                                                             

```

Given the list of strings, and a maximum number of characters per line, format the table using the maximum  
number of columns without violating the line width constraint.  
Column width should be equal

[NetElixir | Software Engineer 1 | Hyderabad | Dec 2022](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2879756/NetElixir-or-Software-Engineer-1-or-Hyderabad-or-Dec-2022)

Round 1:  
a. Print prime number from 1 to N  
b. Given input: BBAABC -> output : B2A2B1C1 (print number of times a char comes consecutively) : solved by 2 pointer approach

Round 2:  
a. Cycle detection in linkedlist: solved by normal slow and fast pointer approach  
b. Min Path taken by a knight in a chess board to reach from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2):  
i. I was able to find the min step needed by knight to reach from source to destination using normal BFS but couldn't find the path. Is it possible to get the minimum path using BFS?  
ii. Actually, initally the question was about finding the minimum steps to reach destination. I took around 20 minutes to come up with a BFS solution. When 5 minutes were remaining, the interviewer changed the question to tracking the path as well. I told him that it could be done using backtracking. He wanted me to code the entire solution in 5 minutes.

Result: Rejected

[Difficult task for an interview at Meta (Facebook)](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2902467/Difficult-task-for-an-interview-at-Meta-%28Facebook%29)

Hi there,

I have a problem with this task with Python code.

Alex was asked to mark up a huge number of pictures. Looking at the deadline and at a huge number of pictures of pictures, Alex realized that he did not have time to do everything himself. However, he had many, many friends who were ready to help him! He gave each of his friends a certain number of tasks in order to label the pictures together.  
Not all of Alex's friends are conscientious and considerate performers. However, Alex is not just Alex either; Alex - was an analyst and came up with the idea that you need to give each task to several friends, and as an answer to the task to believe - the most frequently encountered answer.  
Help Alex restore the final answers to the problem based on the verdicts of your friends.

**Input form.**  
On each input line (an unknown number of lines), you are given the verdict of one friend for one of the tasks in the format separated by a space:  
<worker_id> <task_id>  
where <worker_id> is some string that uniquely identifies a friend, <task_id> is a string that uniquely identifies the task, and is some integer that is responsible for the answer to the task

**Output form.**  
As an answer to the problem, you need to display the verdicts for the problem on separate lines:  
<task_id>  
<task_id> from separated by a space  
Important, when outputting <task_id> must be sorted in ascending lexicographic order.

**Important:**  if there are several most frequently encountered answers to the problem, choose the answer with the smallest value.  
**Moreover,**  verdicts can be not only 0 or 1
