[Google onsite coding question 2022](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1835838/Google-onsite-coding-question-2022)

Given an array, a window must be chosen such that this component maximized where i and j are indices â€” sum(a[i]...a[j])(j-i+1), but the component must be equal to or less than the threshold  _(sum(a[i]...a[j])(j-i+1) <= threshold_).

How we can solve this question optimally?

One example of the problem:

Input

N: 8  
Arr[]: [2,-3,-4,5,5,6,7,8]  
Ind: 4  
Threshold = 20

Output

One possible answer  
[5,5]

Explanation of output  
[5, 5] = 10*2 = 20 <= 20 (threshold)
