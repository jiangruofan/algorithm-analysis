Question: Given a linkedlist reverse in k groups from the end.  
Ex- 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 , k = 4  
Solution: 1-5-4-3-2-9-8-7-6

First approach: Reverse => Normal k reverse from start=> reverse again

The above approach required 3*O(n), interviewer asked to reduce iterations, then I came up with below approach.

Final approach :

Reverse the given linkedlist then find and attach with next header (as per k rule).  
Ex- 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 , k = 4

9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 [step-1 reversing whole linkedlist]  
[step-2] Get next kth chunk and attach tail with prev head  
(9-8-7-6)-> null  
(5-4-3-2)->(9-8-7-6)  
(1)->(5-4-3-2)->(9-8-7-6) [final ans]

答案: 先找到所有的k个区间 然后设置cur pre两个指针
